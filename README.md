## Get Started

Prerequisites:

- The latest LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- The [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-npm) package manager

Running a development server:

1. clone this repository 
2. using a terminal, `cd` into the newly project directory
3. install all dependencies with `pnpm install`
4. run the development server with `pnpm dev`
5. open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173/`

## Compiling a distributable bundle

Follow steps 1 - 3 from the getting started guide, then run `pnpm build` to create a deployable bundle. This command will compile all assets into the `dist` folder in your project root. You can then copy the contents of the folder to a webserver or static webhosting.
